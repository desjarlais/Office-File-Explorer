# Office-File-Explorer

The purpose of this tool is to provide potential file specific troubleshooting of Office Open Xml formatted documents for Word, Excel or PowerPoint (.docx, .dotx, .docm, .xlsx, .xlst, .xlsm, .pptx, .pptm).

Keep in mind if you use this on a production document and choose to use something that removes data, you should be working on a copy of the file.  This tool should be used to test if it can fix or show what part of the file could be causing some type of behavior that is not expected.
